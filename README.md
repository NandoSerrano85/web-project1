  **Note** The purpose will also help you determine who your user is.

  -How will the user interact with your website?
> example: for a photography blog site one of the main interactions would beadding pictures so make that the main tab or first tab

  -What are the main feautures of the site?
> example: think of a wish list of things you would like your site to do / have. 

  -Does your site require a database?
> example: Depending on the type of site your trying to build you may not need a database or you might need a NoSQL database. A resume website would not need a database.

  -What platform would you like your site to be served on?
> example: you decide if you want your site to be mobile first or desktop first.
