```example: a site for social good, a resume website, a blog, a ecommerce, etc. ```
  **Note** The purpose will also help you determine who your user is.

  -How will the user interact with your website?
```example: for a photography blog site one of the main interactions would beadding pictures so make that the main tab or first tab```

  -What are the main feautures of the site?
```example: think of a wish list of things you would like your site to do / have. ```
  -Does your site require a database?
```example: Depending on the type of site your trying to build you may not need a database or you might need a NoSQL database. A resume website would not need a database.```
