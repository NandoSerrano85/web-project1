## Phases for designing and developing a website:
  * Phase 1: Plan
  * Phase 2: Design
  * Phase 3: Develop

**Note** this is just a guide line to help you get started.

### Phase 1: Planning

Try to answer some of these questions in order to help you plan for your website:

  * What is the purpose of your site?
> example: a site for social good, a resume website, a blog, a ecommerce, etc. 
  **Note** The purpose will also help you determine who your user is.

  * How will the user interact with your website?
> example: for a photography blog site one of the main interactions would beadding pictures so make that the main tab or first tab

  * What are the main feautures of the site?
> example: think of a wish list of things you would like your site to do / have. 

  * Does your site require a database?
> example: Depending on the type of site your trying to build you may not need a database or you might need a NoSQL database. A resume website would not need a database.

  * What platform would you like your site to be served on?
> example: you decide if you want your site to be mobile first or desktop first.

  * What is your time line?
  **Note** Make a time line it helps keep you motivated and keeps you moving forward to completion

Please keep in mind to make sure you make time to work on your projects

### Phase 2: Design

Some of the tools you could use to help you design your application:
    * Paper
    * Pencil
    * inDesign
    * XD
    * Illustrator
    * Gimp
    * InkScape

What you would want to focus on as you are designing your website/ web app is put your self in the shoes of your users and think how will they interact with it, as well as, what tools will they need to make their expereince better.

Make sure to have a preaty substacial list of items. It can be from how the profile page would work, or how they would naviagte yor site.

Now that you have your list make a seperate list of what i would call backend items you will need to help you achive some of your user design ideas. For example if you want an indevisual experience for each user you might want a database that can store user preferences.

now that you have your list of items for front end and back end along with designs we now need to create a rather diagram that connects front end items to the backend items that will provide functionality to the front end items.

Once you have a diagram that covers all front end items with at least one backend item we are ready to develop.
